## Overview

> This project focuses on building a deep learning model for classifying playing cards using the PyTorch framework. The dataset contains images of playing cards, and the model is trained on a subset of these images to predict card classes accurately.

## Dataset

> The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
[Cards Image Dataset for Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification)

***P.s.: The dataset is large and cannot be directly included in this repository. Please download it from the link above and extract it into the appropriate folder :)***
